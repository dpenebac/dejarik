Rules (Jedi Challenges 2017)
Justification
- wanted to choose official rulling
- galaxy's edge version is hella boring
- im also a sucker for having non random games (no name publishing)

2 Players
- Players pick four pieces
- no limit to which, repeated
- Role dice to choose who places piece on board first
- place in legal position

Win Status
- Destroying all oponents pieces

Board
- 25 spaces
- 3 rings (orbits)
- 12 segments (rays)
- Outer Orbit, Middle Orbit, Center Orbit (Dejarik)

Play
- move then attack
- attack then move
- special then move
- move then special
- (special replaces attack)
- Attack Rules
- adjacent and in range to piece (range=1 means adjacent)
- attacked_unit.health -= attacking_unit.attack
- 
- Move Rules
- must move to empty square
- do you have to move?
- no

Pieces
- 8 pieces, each unique
- health
- attack
- range (attack range)
- movement
- special ability (this will be fun to implement)

- Speical Abilities
  - heal (active heal adjacent unit)
  - recovery (passive heal)
  - reach (attack several pieces at once, passive)
  - double attack (attacks twice in one turn, passive)
  - stun (active, replaces attack action, stuns 2 turns, must recharge next turn)
- takeaways
  - both passive and active need to be handled
  - active means it replaces attack
  - stun/recharge can be implemented similarily
  - Build in a way to make ability to have more special abilities/units
